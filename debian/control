Description: A more sophisticated history search for the Fish Shell
 re-search is a tool and accompanying shell scripts for providing an advanced
 history search for the Fish Shell.
 .
 re-search can be used with Bash as well, but only with some restrictions. The
 search too itself fully works, but it is only able to fill the matching command
 line into the current prompt. For executing the prompt (or even navigating to
 the cursor position from inside re-search) would only be possible via
 additional external tool (which this package doesnâ€™t provide).
